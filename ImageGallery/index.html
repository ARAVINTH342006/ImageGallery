                <li><strong>Energy & nutrients:</strong> Provides calories and essential nutrients (carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals) to fuel the body and build/repair tissues</li>
                <li><strong>Survival span:</strong> People can survive weeks without food, but strength, immunity, and mental clarity decline rapidly</li>
                <li><strong>Physical and mental health:</strong> Nourishment prevents malnutrition, supports immune health, and sustains cognitive performance and morale</li>

            <ul class="Shelter" id="informations">
                <li><strong>Protection & survival:</strong> Shields us from extreme temperatures, wind, rain, predators, and insects—preventing hypothermia, heat stroke, and injury</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological stability:</strong> Offers safety, privacy, and emotional comfort—reducing stress and supporting mental well-being</li>
                <li><strong>Foundation for growth:</strong> Once basic shelter is secured, individuals can focus on food, water, and eventually higher-level needs (social, esteem, growth)</li>
                <li><strong>Survival timeline:</strong> While food may last weeks, exposure might kill in hours or days, making shelter often equally urgent</li>

                <li><strong>Hydration & bodily functions</strong> : Water makes up <span>~60–70%</span> of our bodies, vital for digestion, nutrient transport, waste removal, temperature regulation, and cell health</li>
                <li><strong>Survival window:</strong> A person can only survive about <span>3–5</span> days without water; mild dehydration quickly impairs thinking and focus</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum need:</strong> About <span>3 L</span>/day for drinking, and around <span>50 L</span>/day total is recommended to cover hygiene and sanitation</li>
                <li><strong>Health & safety:</strong> Clean water prevents dangerous diseases—like cholera and dysentery—which affect billions when sanitation is poor </li>
